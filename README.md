# Poldis NewTab
Poldis NewTab is an extension for Chrome that changes your new tab  
You decide which wep page or local file gets shown (URL/Path)  

## Custom New Tab  
If you want a better new tab page, you can try using my design together with this extension. It's available here: https://poldisweb.de/newtab, this is also the link you will need to enter into the address input to use it as your new tab page.

## Features
· **URL / Local Path** instead of a new tab page  
· Choose **whether** to **redirect** them to the site **or open** them **as the new tab**  
· Custom **page title**  

## How to add it

I didn't create all of this myself, [antwhere.com](antwhere.com) originally built it ("blank" - available in the Chrome Extensions webstore).
